\section{Education}
\cventry{2008--2013}{Master's degree}{Sevastopol National University of Nuclear Energy and Industry}{Institue of Atomic Energy}{Automation of technological processes and manufactures}{%
I was involved in application development. The application used multigrids to prepare cartographic data for route-finding algorithms. Regarding this, there is a certificate (No 46694) of registration of copyright on the product:
\begin{itemize}
\item [Title] The computer program ``Raster map images to multigrid converter with subsequent conversion into graph-based data structures''
\item [Authors] Mikhnev Sergey S., Kulik Nikolay S., Kvasnikov Vladimir P., Kanaev Sergey V.

\section{Experience}
\cventry{Jan 2015 --- Sep 2016}{Engineer}{Satellite Soft Labs}{Saratov}{\newline{}SmartTrans NaviCore v3 modules development}{During this work I've developed:%
\begin{itemize}%
\item GPS/GLONASS telematic data from tracker/relay receiving servers;
\item telematic data filtering modules;
\item \texttt{bash} scripts to manage pipelined group of processes as single instance in a way like Linux daemons;
\item unified modules interface to have ability to use as standalone applications;
\item component watchdog.
\end{itemize} %
Also, I have implemented wrapper libraries that are used in product development implement: %
\begin{itemize}
\item asynchronous processing employing \texttt{epoll} and \texttt{eventfd} mechanisms;
\item thread pool;
\item \texttt{TCP/IP} connection and asynchronous data receive/transmit;
\item coroutines.
\end{itemize} %
During this work I've had experience with:%
\begin{itemize}
\item libraries: \texttt{Boost.Asio}, \texttt{libmicrohttpd}, \texttt{cpp-netlib}, \texttt{libpqxx}, \texttt{libsqlite3}, \texttt{libdl};
\item kernel subsystems: \texttt{epoll}, \texttt{UNIX-sockets};
\item shell scripting: \texttt{bash};
\item multithreading: concurrent and cooperative;
\item STL.
\end{itemize}}
\cventry{Jul 2013 -- Nov 2014}{Engineer}{Samsung R\&D Institute Ukraine}{Kharkov}{\newline{}System software development for Tizen OS}{\textbf{Responsibilities:}%
\begin{itemize}
\item writing system software code which does:use DBus interprocess communication, controls
processes, controls processes with systemd startup manager API;
\item writing middleware code that uses EFL GUI library;
\item writing middleware code for xserver input driver, modifying enlightenment window manager
input modules;
\item writing unit-tests and functional tests using check framework.
\end{itemize}}

\section{About myself}
\par{I've had vast experience in:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{C} and \texttt{C++} development for GNU/Linux with CLI and \texttt{EFL} or \texttt{QT} GUI, including interprocess communications using \texttt{UNIX sockets}, \texttt{pipe}s and a little of \texttt{DBus} IPC;
\item \texttt{bash} shell scripting to run pipelined processes as some sort of daemon with status acquisition, start/stop/restart methods support with per-instance static configuration.
\end{itemize}
\par{I have experience with test-driven development.}
\par{While programming with C++ I've used \texttt{Boost.Asio}, \texttt{STL}, multithreaded and cooperative multitasking.}
\par{Also I've had experience developing embedded projects with Atmel's 8-bit MCU. These projects were intended to control a set of stepper motors and employed distributed logic to simulate air flow pressures in wind tunnel and simulate liquid flow. For both these projects I've developed both hardware and software.}
\par{I've participated at development of the system to monitor vehicles and theirs telemetry and raise an alarm or notification in case of some event (like fueling, drain, enter/exit geo-zone) with satellite navigation technologies (GPS/GLONASS). This required parsing of GPS/GLONASS trackers' protocols, implementing geo-mathematical algorithms, sensor data filtering, etc.}
\par{At the same time I've had moderate experience with Postgre and SQLite 3 databases in this project.}
\par{Also, I was involved in development of application that used multigrids to prepare cartographic data for route-finding algorithms based on graph data structures.}
\par{Currently I am learning Linux kernel and driver development.}
\par{Also, I'm interested in studying analogue and digital circuitry and ARM assembly as well as networking protocols and cryptography.}
